# Summary

The **Closest String Problem (CSP)** is a classical NP-hard optimization problem with many applications in computational biology, such as motif discovery, consensus sequence identification, and error correction in biological sequences. Formally, given a set of strings \(S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_n\}\) of length \(d\) over an alphabet \(\Sigma\), CSP asks for a center string \(x \in \Sigma^d\) that minimizes  
\[
\max_{i} \mathrm{HammingDistance}(x, s_i).
\]

Recent work has expanded both theoretical understanding and heuristic methods:

- **Abdi et al. (2024)** present a **three-stage heuristic algorithm** combining alphabet pruning, beam search guided by an expected‐distance heuristic, and local search; they test on synthetic and real gene sequence datasets and show improvements in quality vs prior heuristics. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **Abboud et al. (2023)** study complexity limits: for the continuous CSP (center any string in \(\Sigma^d\)) they show that under SETH one cannot do significantly better than exhaustive search; for the discrete CSP (center must be one of the input strings), they give tighter algorithms in certain regimes of string length \(d\), and lower‐bounds in others. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Despite these advances, there remains a lack of a full benchmarking framework that allows fair comparisons across heuristic and exact methods, supports biological data formats, enables reproducibility with resource tracking, and provides interfaces suited for both research and applied settings. **CSPBench** is intended to fill that gap.

# Statement of Need

Researchers working on CSP face several challenges:

1. **Benchmarking gap**: although new heuristics such as Abdi et al. (2024) exist, they are tested only in limited contexts; comparisons to exact or baseline methods under identical conditions are rare.  
2. **Theoretical vs empirical trade-offs**: Abboud et al. (2023) establish lower bounds and complexity regimes, but do not always provide implementations to compare practically, especially on data of biological interest.  
3. **Limited reproducibility**: differences in dataset choice, string length, alphabet size, configuration of heuristics complicate reproduction and cross-paper comparison.  
4. **Tooling needs**: the absence of standard tools to load data (FASTA etc.), generate synthetic instances, monitor execution (time, memory, convergence), and archive results with metadata.  

CSPBench is designed to address these issues by:

- Offering a modular architecture to integrate both heuristic methods (e.g. beam search + local search) and exact or baseline methods;  
- Including implementations of algorithms like those by Abdi et al. and discrete/continuous versions where feasible, to enable side-by-side comparison;  
- Providing support for biological and synthetic datasets, including FASTA support and data generation;  
- Enabling metrics beyond just solution quality: execution time, memory use, convergence curves;  
- Multiple interfaces (CLI, Web, REST API) to make the framework usable in different settings.

| Work | Contributions | Gaps / Where CSPBench adds value |

| **Abdi et al. (2024)**: *A Three-Stage Algorithm for the Closest String Problem on Artificial and Real Gene Sequences* | Proposes a heuristic algorithm in three stages; introduces real gene datasets; shows better results vs older heuristics. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} | No framework provided; limited to heuristic methods; no extensive comparison with exact methods on large alphabets or long string length; little support for reproducibility (e.g. resource monitoring) in published comparison. |
| **Abboud et al. (2023)**: *Can You Solve Closest String Faster Than Exhaustive Search?* | Provides complexity lower bounds under SETH; distinguishes between continuous vs discrete variants; gives faster algorithms in certain regimes of \(n, d\). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} | Focus is mainly theoretical; lacks implementation detail for many cases; does not focus on bioinformatics datasets nor data format integration; not designed as a benchmarking tool. |
| **Other older works** | There are many heuristic and approximation algorithm papers; exact methods, parameterized complexity results; but often fragmented. | No existing toolkit that combines noisy heuristics, exact baselines, interfaces, reproducibility, biological datasets into one extendable benchmarking system. |

# Implementation (adapted to only two reference works)

CSPBench will include algorithm implementations that cover or approximate the methods in the two reference papers, plus baseline exact methods, so that comparisons can be meaningful.

## Algorithm Implementations

- **Baseline**: brute-force (exact) enumeration of all possible center strings in \(\Sigma^d\) (continuous CSP).  
- **Discrete baseline**: checking only input strings as possible centers.  
- **Three-Stage Heuristic**: reproduction / adaptation of the algorithm by Abdi et al. (2024): (1) alphabet pruning, (2) beam search with expected-distance heuristic, (3) local search.  
- **Fast discrete / continuous algorithm improvements**: implementing algorithmic ideas from Abboud et al. (2023), especially in their regimes where improvements to exhaustive search are possible.

## Data & Experiments

- Synthetic datasets of varying \(n\), \(d\), alphabet size \(|\Sigma|\), to explore the regimes analyzed in Abboud et al.  
- Real gene‐sequence datasets of moderate size (as used by Abdi et al.).  
- Metrics to collect: solution radius (max Hamming distance to input strings), runtime, memory usage, convergence (when applicable), quality of heuristic vs exact.

# Conclusion

By focusing on the two recent, strong contributions (Abdi et al. 2024; Abboud et al. 2023) and providing other baselines, CSPBench can offer a robust, reproducible, and usable platform for comparing CSP algorithms. This will help researchers understand which algorithms are best under which settings (string length, alphabet size, continuous vs discrete), facilitate reproduction of results, and serve as a foundation for integrating future algorithms.
